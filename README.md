### ðŸŽ¨ RGB Color Picker with Processing and Arduino

This project lets you pick a color from an on-screen palette using your mouse. After clicking the palette, moving the cursor sends the RGB value of the selected color to an Arduino over USB. The Arduino then updates an RGB LED to match the color under the cursor in real-time.
